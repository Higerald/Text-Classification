This project is to perform "Text Classification" on IMDB Dataset.
The Dataset consists of 25,000 training samples and 25,000 test samples.
This is a binary classification task.
The dataset has been extracted from the hugging face daatasets.
I have used a Disltilbert model.
The test accuracy is close to 92.19%
